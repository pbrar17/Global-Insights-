The FinalProject.ipnyb file has a dashboard at the very end, which is interactable, and allows the users to see different trends in data in Different Countries from Earthquakes to Generosity, 
Everything is interactable, and allows user to fine tune their search to see trends in their chosen frame, from chosing to isolate for a continent, or for a particular group of countries by multi-selection. 
This code was written by Pahul Brar, with some contribution from Abheet Kansal. I have forked the directory, to have better access to it. All data used was taken from open source datasets, and were linked to in the final published report, which is not available in Github.
You may need to install/update some of the packages to properly view the dashboard.
